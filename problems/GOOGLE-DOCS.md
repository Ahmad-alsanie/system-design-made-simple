# Google Docs
A platform that enables users to create, edit, share, and collaborate on documents online in real-time.

## Functional Requirements
- Document Management: Users can create, edit, delete, and organize documents. 
- Real-Time Editing and Collaboration: Multiple users can edit a document simultaneously, with changes reflected in real-time. 
- Access Control and Sharing: Users can set sharing permissions (view, comment, edit) for each document. 
- Document Versioning: Keep track of changes and allow users to revert to previous versions. 
- Formatting Tools: Provide a range of text formatting options (fonts, colors, alignment). 
- Commenting and Chat: Users can comment on specific parts of a document and chat in real-time. 
- Offline Access: Allow users to edit documents offline, syncing changes when online. 
- Cross-Platform Compatibility: Ensure compatibility across various devices and operating systems.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Scalability: Support a large number of concurrent users and documents. 
- Real-Time Performance: Ensure minimal latency for real-time collaboration features. 
- Data Consistency: Maintain strong consistency, especially for collaborative editing. 
- High Availability and Reliability: System should be highly available with minimal downtime.
- Security: Secure user data and documents, especially during transmission and storage. 
- Backup and Disaster Recovery: Regular backups and effective recovery strategies to prevent data loss.

## System APIs
- Document API:
```
createDocument(api_key, user_id, document_details)
updateDocument(api_key, user_id, document_id, content_changes)
deleteDocument(api_key, user_id, document_id)
```

- Collaboration API:
```
shareDocument(api_key, user_id, document_id, share_settings)
addComment(api_key, user_id, document_id, comment_details)
editCollaboratively(api_key, document_id, content_changes)
```
- User Management API:
```
registerUser(api_key, user_details)
authenticateUser(api_key, username, password)
getUserProfile(api_key, user_id)
```

## Defining Data Model
- User: Stores user details like userID, username, email, etc. 
- Document: Linked to User, contains document content, metadata, version history. 
- Comment: Linked to specific parts of a Document, contains user comments. 
- Access Control: Defines permissions for different users for each document.

## High-Level Design
- Microservices Architecture: Different services for document management, user management, real-time editing, etc.
- Database Design: Combination of SQL (for structured data like user profiles) and NoSQL (for document content and versioning).
- Real-Time Synchronization Service: Handles real-time updates to documents being collaboratively edited.
- Authentication Service: Manages user authentication and session management.
- Access Control Service: Handles permissions and sharing settings for documents.

## Scaling and Performance Optimization
- Load Balancing: Distribute requests across servers to handle high user loads.
- Optimized Data Synchronization: Efficient algorithms to minimize the data transfer for real-time collaboration.
- Caching: Implement caching for frequently accessed documents to improve read performance.
- Database Optimization: Use database sharding for scalability and faster read/write operations.

## Bottlenecks
- Concurrency Handling in Real-Time Editing: Use operational transformation or conflict-free replicated data types (CRDTs) to handle simultaneous edits and avoid conflicts.
- Database Performance: Regular monitoring and optimization, like indexing and query optimization, to handle large datasets efficiently.
- Network Latency: Implement efficient data compression and transmission protocols to minimize latency in real-time collaboration.

## User Impact and Experience Enhancement
- Intuitive User Interface: A clean, user-friendly interface that makes document creation, editing, and collaboration straightforward and efficient.
- Real-Time Collaboration Feedback: Visual indicators for who is editing the document and where, enhancing the collaborative experience.
- Accessibility Features: Ensure the platform is accessible to users with disabilities, with features like screen reader compatibility and keyboard navigation.

## Business Impact Metrics
- Active Users and Engagement: Track the number of active users and their engagement levels (time spent, number of documents edited, etc.).
- Collaboration Metrics: Measure the frequency and depth of collaborative activities (number of shared documents, comments made, etc.).
- Document Creation and Retention Rate: Monitor the rate of new document creation and how long users retain their documents on the platform.
