# Code Share
A platform that enables you to share code

## Functional Requirements

1- Repository Management: Users can create, update, and delete code repositories.

2- Code Browsing and Editing: Web-based interface for viewing and editing code with syntax highlighting.

3- Collaboration Tools: Support for pull requests, code reviews, and issue tracking.

4- Version Control System (VCS) Integration: Seamless integration with VCS like Git.

5- User Authentication and Profiles: User account creation, authentication, and profile management.

6- Search Functionality: Search across repositories, users, and code snippets.

7- Notification System: Alerts for repository updates, pull requests, and issue tracking.

## Non-Functional Requirements
1- Scalability: Handle a high number of concurrent users and repositories.

2- High Availability: Ensure minimal downtime.

3- Security: Secure storage and transmission of code, especially for private repositories.

4- Backup and Recovery: Regular backups and effective disaster recovery strategies.

## System APIs:
- Repository API:
```
createRepository(api_key, user_id, repository_details)
updateRepository(api_key, user_id, repository_id, repository_details)
deleteRepository(api_key, user_id, repository_id)
```

- Code Browsing API:
```
viewCode(api_key, repository_id, file_path)
editCode(api_key, user_id, repository_id, file_path, code_content)
```

- Search API:
```
search(api_key, query, filter_type, page_number, page_size)
```

- User Management API:
```
createUser(api_key, user_details)
authenticateUser(api_key, username, password)
updateUserProfile(api_key, user_id, profile_details)
```

- Collaboration API:
```
createPullRequest(api_key, user_id, repository_id, pr_details)
reviewCode(api_key, user_id, pull_request_id, comments)
trackIssue(api_key, user_id, repository_id, issue_details)
```

## Defining Data Model
1- User: Contains user details like userID, username, email, etc.

2- Repository: Linked to User, contains repository details.

3- Code File: Linked to Repository, contains file details and code content.

4- Pull Request/Issue: Linked to Repository, contains details about collaborative elements.

## High Level Design
- Microservices Architecture: Separate services for repository management, user management, collaboration tools, etc.
- Database: Use a combination of SQL (for structured data like user profiles) and NoSQL databases (for unstructured data like code content).
- VCS Integration Service: Handles communication with external VCS systems. 
- Authentication Service: Manages user authentication and session management. 
- Search Service: Handles all search-related functionalities. 
- Notification Service: Manages sending out notifications to users.

## Scaling and Performance
- Load Balancing: Use load balancers to distribute requests evenly across servers, ensuring high availability and fault tolerance.

- Caching: Implement caching for frequently accessed data, like popular repositories and user profiles, to reduce database load and improve response times.

- Database Optimization: Use database sharding or partitioning to manage large datasets and maintain performance. Indexing should be used effectively for quicker search and query operations.

- Content Delivery Network (CDN): Use a CDN for distributing static content such as documentation, images, and basic web assets. This reduces latency and improves user experience.

- Asynchronous Processing: Use message queues and asynchronous processing for operations that do not need immediate response, such as indexing new code pushes and processing pull requests.

- Microservices Scaling: Scale microservices independently based on demand. For example, the user authentication service may require more resources during peak login times.

- Monitoring and Logging: Implement a robust monitoring and logging system to track performance metrics and quickly identify issues.

## Bottleneck Identification and Mitigation
- Database Bottlenecks: Regularly monitor database performance. Optimize queries, and consider read-replicas for heavy read operations.

- Network Latency: Optimize network protocols and use efficient data serialization formats to reduce the amount of data transferred over the network.

- Service Downtime: Implement circuit breakers and fallback mechanisms in microservices to handle failures gracefully.

## User Impact and Experience Enhancement
- Intuitive UI/UX: Design a user-friendly interface that makes navigation, code browsing, and collaboration easy and efficient. 
- Real-Time Collaboration Features: Integrate real-time code editing and communication tools to enhance collaborative coding experiences. 
- Personalized Notifications: Tailor notifications based on user activities and preferences to keep them engaged without overwhelming them.

## Business Impact Metrics
- Active Users: Track the number of active users as a measure of platform engagement.
- Repository Creation Rate: Monitor the rate at which new repositories are created to gauge user adoption.
- Collaboration Metrics: Measure pull request and issue tracking activities to understand collaboration levels on the platform.
