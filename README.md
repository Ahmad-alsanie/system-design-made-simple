**Distributed system?**

A system consists of multiple computers that communicate and interact with each other to achieve a certain goal

<br/>

**Advantages of distributed computing?**
  - Zero latency
  - Infinite bandwidth
  - Secure network
  - Transport cost is near zero
  - One admin

<br/>

**Define UDP & give some common use cases?**

User datagram protocol runs over IP and used to establish low latency & loss tolerating connections between applications.
It speeds up transmission by enabling the transfer of data before an agreement is established with the receiving party.
  * Use cases:
    * VOIP
    * DNS lookups
    * Video and audio playback

<br/>

**Define TCP & give some common use cases?**

Transmission control protocol provides a reliable, ordered, error checked delivery of a stream of bytes.
Connections are established before data is sent which makes it slower than UDP however data loss is intolerant.
  - Use cases
    - SMTP
    - SSH
    - FTP
    - Telnet
    - HTTP

<br/>

**Differences between UDP & TCP?**
<p align="center">

  <br/>
</p>

<br/>

**Define DNS?**

Domain name service is a hierarchical system that primarily translates names into IP addresses

<br/>

**Types of scaling?**

    1- Vertical scaling: adding more power/resources' interim of hardware (CPU, Disk, RAMs, SSDs etc...)

    2- Horizontal scaling: accept a ciel for hardware and get more servers with fewer capabilities

<br/>

**What is PACELC theorem ?**

PACELC theorem states that if there's a partition a system can trade of between A(availability) and C(consistency).
E(else) the trade of is between C(consistency) & L(latency)

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/PACELC.png">
  <br/>
</p>

<br/>

**Map the following DBs to their PACELC properties ?**

</p>

<br/>

**Data partitioning and distribution challenges?**

- Map specific node to what data it holds
- How to distribute data when adding or deleting a node

<br/>

**Suggest a solution to solve data partitioning challenges?**

Use consistent hashing

<br/>

**How does consistent hashing works?**

It maps data to physical nodes by using a ring and if a new node is introduced a minimal movement is required by accommodating the following rules:
- Hash range is in between (1-100)
- Ranges (100/number of nodes)
- Tokens are distributed across the ranges and represent data

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/consistent-hashing.png">
  <br/>
</p>

<br/>

**What's a hotspot in DB partitioning?**

A server that's responsible for a huge partition of data that became a bottleneck after being hit with many requests

<br/>

**How does consistent hashing handles node addition ?**

Make use of VNodes, virtual node that represents subrange in each physical node

**What are the properties of virtual nodes?**
  - Assigned randomly so no two neighboring VNodes are assigned to the same physical node
  - Carry replicas for fault tolerance
  - Some servers might hold more VNodes than others

<br/>

**What's the problem of using round-robin to control LB lookups?**
  - Servers may crash due to power users assigned to the same server
  - Cashing might also overload certain servers due to IP lookups for previous users

<br/>

  - Canary deployment: used to release features in patches
  - Atomic deployment: using a single instance to perform deployment then change directories when an instance is done
  - Shadow deployment: a shadow deployment strategy is one where the new version is available alongside the old version in prediction, but a copy or forked version of traffic to the older version is sent to the new version for production testing
  - A/B testing deployment: strategy relies on real-world statistical data to decide on a rollout or rollback.

A communication infrastructure for services to communicate (consumer, provider and orchestrator: provides rules for proxies on how to behave)

<br/>

**Database per service patter - Saga?**

A sequence of local where if one fails saga executes a rollback to prevent impact

<br/>

**APIs?**

Contacts to exchange data

<br/>

**How to make sure your distributed cache stays consistent?**
  - Use a central cache system e.g. redis
  - Add a well-defined TTL
  - Use resource version keeper

<br/>

**When integrating a third party API what design pattern that first comes to your mind?**

Circuit breaker pattern

<br/>

**In Cassandra, you model your data for____?**

Reads, design around queries rather than writing your queries around your data model

<br/>
**GRPC?**

Language Agnostic API based on RPC, uses proto buffers which facilitate http2(data as binary)

<br/>

**Example.proto**

```
syntax = "proto3";

message Ping{
String name=1;
}

message PingRequest{
Ping ping = 1;
}

message PingResponse{
String result=1;
}

service PingService{
rpc ping(PingRequest){
return PingResponse;
}
}
```

**Differences between protobuf and json?**
  - json encoded as a string
  - protobuf encoded as binary

<br/>

**Blob storage?**

A binary storage e.g. S3

<br/>

**L1 Vs. L2 caching?**
  - L1: smaller memory capacity, faster access and no need to refresh (SRAM)
  - L2: accessed after L1 is searched, slower, need to be refreshed (DRAM)

<br/> 

**Inheritance Vs. Composition?**
  - Inheritance: designing around what the objects are
  - Composition: designing around actions

<br/>

**Mechanisms to free up (evict) cache?**
  - LRU (least recently used)
  - LFU (least frequently used)

<br/>

**How to calculate TTL?**
  - Historical data
  - Use cases
  - Monitor hit, miss and stale data ratio

<br/>

**Kafka APIs?**
  - Admin api
  - Producer api
  - Consumer api
  - Kafka streams api
  - Connect api

<br/>

**Circuit-breaker pattern?**
  - detect something is wrong
  - take temporary steps to avoid worsening the situation
  - deactivate problematic component

<br/>

**Circuit-breaker parameters?**
  - number of retries
  - threshold(how many failures before breaking the circuit)
  - timeout
  - how long to wait for to trigger a retry


<br/>

**Java concurrency synchronizers?**

**Design patterns**
Creational: singleton, factory and builder
Structural: Adapter, Bridge, Composite and Decorator

- Singleton: ensures that only one instance of the class exists in the Java Virtual Machine.
- Factory: used when we have a superclass with multiple subclasses and based on input, we need to return one of the subclasses.
- Builder: solves the issue with a large number of optional parameters and inconsistent state by providing a way to build the object step-by-step and provide a method that will actually return the final Object.
- Adapter: use an existing class that doesn't fit into my hierarchy third-party library e.g. asList method in Arrays class to allow arrays and lists to work interchangeably with each other
- Bridge: simplifies complex hierarchy and make it easier to add new functionality: e.g shapes and redSquare and color shape interface (loose coupling and more flexibility)
- Composite: when you want to treat a single object and a group of objects in the same way, when you have code that very similar or identical to handle different types of objects e.g. different Employees with different pay methods to implement a common interface payee and pass down one method only to pay expenses instead of three
- Decorator: add extra decoration functionality to an object dynamically and when you need more flexibility than subclassing allows e.g I have circle class that implements component and I printed three circles but what if I only need one of them to be with red border solution: create a decorator class that has a field for decorated component takes a component in the constructor and make your init of a new circle point to ColoredComponent(circle)
- Facade: hiding the complexity of implementation of different components e.g. hotel, flight and car booking classes that can all be joined in a vacation facade class that handles all the booking and promotes loose coupling
- Proxy: a substitute for a real object e.g. bank card instead of real money. image loader that only calls the expensive methods e.g. load image from desk when needed (lazy loading)
  Common uses of a proxy patterns includes: representing expensive database operations, authenticating access and representing large objects in GUI
